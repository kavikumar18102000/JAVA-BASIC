Java is purely an object oriented language.

Java is both compile and interpreted language.

The source code is compiled to a byte-code and the it is interpreted.

											Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
											
																				
				
Object oriented programming tries to map code instructions with the real world making the code short and easier to understand.	
	

What is Object Oriented Programming ?
		solving a problem by creating the objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming. This is known as object oriented programming.
	
DRY ---> Do not repeat yourself --> focuses on code re-usability.

class --> it is a blue-print for creating the objects.

object --> it is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.




Basic terminologies in OOP's :

	* Abstraction : hiding the internal details [showing only essential info !]

	* Encapsulation : the act of putting various components together (into a capsule).
					  In java, encapsulation means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the user.

	* Inheritance : the act of inheriting the property of base class to the derived class.

	* Polymorphism : one entity many forms.
	
	
Access modifiers : specify weather a property or a method is accessible.
	
		Types of modifiers are :
			* Private : cannot be accessed outside the defined class..
			* Public  : can be accessed inside and outside the class..
			* Protected :
			* Default : 


Constructors in Java :
		* A member functions used to initialize an object while creating it.....
		* In order to write our very own constructor, we define a method with same name as the class name...


Constructor Overloading in Java :
			Constructor can be overloaded just like method overloading...
		
		NOTE :
			* Constructors can take parameters without overloading.....
			* There can be more than two overloaded constructors....
